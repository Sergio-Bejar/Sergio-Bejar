### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sergio BÃ©jar and I am an Associate Professor of Political Science currently in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.sjsu.edu/polisci/) at [San Jose State University](https://sjsu.edu/).  My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of Comparative Politics, Political Behavior and Political Methodology. 

My interests here are varied, but I use Github for the following stuff you may find useful:

**R Packages:** I have co-authored the following R packages that may interest you:

**Python Packages:** You might find the following Python packages useful:

|[`IDCeMPy`](https://pypi.org/project/idcempy/)                    | Inflated Discrete Choice Models                                                      |

**Research:** I am relatively new on Github, but I plan to start sharing here the repos of my solo/lead publications. 

**Teaching:** [Introduction to Comparative Politics](https://github.com/Sergio-Bejar/POLS2), [International Political Economy](https://github.com/Sergio-Bejar/POLS155), [Research Methods](https://github.com/Sergio-Bejar/POLS100M). 

**Consulting:** I have also done a few data science consulting projects.  Here is a sample: [Feel like working?](http://www.sergiobejar.com/consultingdata-science.html).

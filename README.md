### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My nme is Sergio BÃ©jar and I am an Associate Professor of Political Science currently in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.sjsu.edu/polisci/) at [San Jose State University](https://sjsu.edu/).  My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of Comparative Politics, Political Behavior and Political Methodology. 

My interests here are varied, but I use Github for the following stuff you may find useful:

**`R` and `Python`:** I have co-authored a few `R` and `Python` packages that may interest you:

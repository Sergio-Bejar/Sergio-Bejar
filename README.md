### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sergio BÃ©jar, and I am a Professor of Political Science currently in the [Department of Political Studies at CIDE, Mexico](https://www.cide.edu/).  My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection of Comparative Politics, Political Economy, and Political Methodology. 

My interests here are varied, but I use Github for the following stuff you may find useful:

**R Packages:** I have co-authored the following R packages:

| Package                                                          | Description                                                                          |

| [`BayesMFSurv`](https://github.com/Nicolas-Schmidt/BayesMFSurv)  | Fits Bayesian split-population (SP) survival models with and wihout misclassified failured events.

**Python Packages:** You might find the following Python packages useful:

|[`IDCeMPy`](https://pypi.org/project/idcempy/)                    | Fits a number of Inflated Discrete Choice Models (ZIOP/C, MIOP/C, GIMNL).![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03322/status.svg) ![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/idcempy) |

**Research:** I plan to start sharing here the repos of my solo and co-authored publications. 

**Teaching:** [Introduction to Comparative Politics](https://github.com/Sergio-Bejar/POLS2), [International Political Economy](https://github.com/Sergio-Bejar/POLS155), [Research Methods](https://github.com/Sergio-Bejar/POLS100M).
